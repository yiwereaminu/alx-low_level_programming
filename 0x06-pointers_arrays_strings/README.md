In this repos, we make a deep dive into pointers, arrays and strings

0-strcat.c : contains a function that concatenates two strings using pointers
1-strncat.c : this program also contains a function that concatenates two strings,
except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be a null-terminated
if it contains n or more bytes.

2-strncpy : contains a function that copies a sting
