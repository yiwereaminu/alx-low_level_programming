# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Description

This project introduces you to the basics of Python programming. You'll learn about Python scripts, printing, formatting, and some fundamental concepts of the language.

## Concepts

- Python programming
- The Python tutorial
- Whetting Your Appetite
- Using the Python Interpreter
- An Informal Introduction to Python (Read up until “3.1.2. Strings” included)
- How To Use String Formatters in Python 3
- Learn to Program
- Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome
- Identify the creator of Python
- Recognize Guido van Rossum as the creator of Python
- Understand where the name 'Python' comes from
- Explain the Zen of Python
- Use the Python interpreter
- Print text and variables using the `print` function
- Work with strings, indexing, and slicing in Python
- Follow the official Python coding style (PEP 8) and check code with `pycodestyle`

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All scripts interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All scripts end with a new line
- The first line of all scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repository containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of this project is mandatory
- Code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All scripts must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Shell Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All scripts tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts exactly two lines long (`wc -l` should print 2)
- All scripts end with a new line
- The first line of all scripts should be `#!/bin/bash`
- All scripts must be executable

### C Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- Code should use the Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file named `lists.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All header files should be include guarded

## Zen

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters:

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

## Pycodestyle

Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code.

## Tasks

### 0. Run Python file

Write a Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

### 1. Run inline

Write a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

### 2. Hello, print

Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line.

### 3. Print integer

Complete the source code to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by "Battery street," and a new line.

### 4. Print float

Complete the source code to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

### 5. Print string

Complete the source code to print 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.

### 6. Play with strings

Complete the source code to print "Welcome to Holberton School!"

### 7. Copy - Cut - Paste

Complete the source code to print substrings from a variable.

### 8. Create a

 new sentence

Complete the source code to print "object-oriented programming with Python," followed by a new line.

### 9. Easter Egg

Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python,” by Tim Peters.

### 10. Linked list cycle

Write a C function that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

### 11. Hello, write

Write a Python script that prints a specific message to `stderr` and exits with a status code of 1.

### 12. Compile

Write a script that compiles a Python script file. The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

### 13. ByteCode -> Python #1

Write a Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that does the same as a given Python bytecode.
